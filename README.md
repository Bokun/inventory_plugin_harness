### Skeleton implementation for BÃ³kun's Inventory Service plugin.

This project should give you a head start if you are implementing Inventory Service plugin in Java.

Please [read the documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uq3wPhTdxONWwTQBRCUyRiY5ljJpJBdyt7rNsk1yLSc/edit?usp=sharing) if you haven't done so.

This project includes necessary dependencies for grpc-generated API skeleton objects and gives a general impression on how we implement those plugins ourselves.

Note that this project has multiple branches: as we (loosely) follow [GitFlow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) semantics, we use `develop` branch for development version and `master` branch for last stable release.
That said, the general advice is to start with latest `develop` in order to be in line with the latest API version.

Requires Java 8.
